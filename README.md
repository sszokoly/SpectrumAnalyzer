# Spectrum Analyzer

## Intro

The purpose behind this simple project was to get familiar with audio recording using python and 
understanding some basic characteristics of audio data.

## Problem

To build a speech recognition ML model fine tuned to recognize your voice you will need to record
your speech for example through your computer microphone and train your model using a dataset build
from those recordings. It is inevitable to also get a good understanding of concepts like sampling rate,
frames, step size, Fast Fourier transform, power spectral density, etc along this journey. Seeing
how the aforementioned terminologies work together to produce a visual waveform and periodogram is often
a good way to solidify the fundamental building blocks of audio data processing.

## Solution

This tool.

## How it works

It captures audio from the computers microphone and produces an almost real-time audio waveform and
a corresponding power spectral density diagram.

## Demo

This is a weak 750Hz sinusoidal tone.
